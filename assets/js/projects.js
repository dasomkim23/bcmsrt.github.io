This work typically includes calling a new case to inform them of their positive result, then conducting a thorough interview to find out who they may have come into contact with as well as other information for documentation purposes. Students also call everyone that person has come into contact with and give directions depending on the nature of the contact and whether the person on the phone has symptoms of COVID.",
